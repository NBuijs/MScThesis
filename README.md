This digital appendix contains:

A) GEE_Code - This code was used in GEE to perform the EVI trend analysis. The assessets can be accessed via https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/BN2/Biotopes1 (Biotopes1), https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/BN2/Biotopes2 (Biotopes2), https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/BN2/Biotopes3 (Biotopes 3), https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/BN2/Biotopes4 (Biotopes 4) and https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/BN2/N2000 (N2000 areas). The code was adapted from Bart Hoekstra (https://github.com/barthoekstra)

B) LULC_Change_Quantification - A overview and quantification of the area per CLC category, change in area per CLC category, and changes in CLC classes and its corresponding change in area. The first sheet illustrates the LULC changes in the N2000 areas and the second sheet illustrates the LULC changes in the biotopes.

C) GIS_Final_Results - In this folder zip files can be found which should be downloaded and extracted with 7-Zip File Manager. When GIS_Final_Results.gdb.zip is extracted, all other files automatically unzip as well. Consequently, a geodatabase is downloaded which provides the final datasets. The final datasets include: EVI_N2000 & EVI_Biotopes for all timeframes, CLC_N2000 & CLC_Biotopes for all timeframes, Hotspots_Biotopes & Hotspots_2000, and Future_2036_Biotopes & and Future_2036_N2000 for the BAU and NI scenario and its subscenarios linear regression & Markov chain.
